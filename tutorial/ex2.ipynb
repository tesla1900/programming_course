    "In the following, we want to develop a program to test positive integer numbers for the prime property. A positive integer larger than 1 is a prime if it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The student Lydia Leibnitz proposes the following algorithm for the task:\n",
    "1. We are given a natural number $n$ that we want to test\n",
    "2. In a loop, we test whether `n % m == 0` for all natural numbers $m$ with $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "3. If the test (2) is `True` for any of the tested $m$, then $n$ is not prime. Otherwise, we have a prime number.\n",

    "Divisors of $n$ come in pairs and say $n = ab$. Then **exactly one** of the two follwing possibilities can be true:\n",

    "2. $a > \\sqrt{n} \\text{ and } b < \\sqrt{n}$\n",

    "To see this, we assume $a< \\sqrt{n} \\text{ and } b < \\sqrt{n}$. Then follows $n = ab < \\sqrt{n}\\sqrt{n} < n$ which leads to the contradiction $n<n$! Similarily, we conclude that not both, $a$ and $b$ can be larger than $\\sqrt{n}$. It follows that one of the divisors of $n$ must be smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ and we only need to test $2\\leq m < \\sqrt{n}$ to check whether $n$ is a prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "1. Implement Lydias algorithm to test a given number $n$ for the prime property. Your program should report with a text-message, which number is tested and whether it is a prime or not.\n",
    "2. Test your program with the numbers 8, 105, 177, 51, 5, 47, 199 and 967. Your program should report the last four numbers as primes and the others as non-prime.\n",
    "3. Embed your test in a loop and consider systematically all numbers $2\\leq n \\leq 100$ for the prime property. What do you observe?\n",
    "4. (3.) should show you that your program does not work as expected! Find the underlying algorithmic problem and correct your program! Document within your notebook or script what the problem is!\n",
